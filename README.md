# Test requirements :

using Next.js &amp; Apollo GraphQL.

features of react like Hooks, Suspense Lazy etc. More brownie points if you use
TypeScript.

names with their addresses, email and phone numbers. Feel free to use any fake
data generator library, btw love https://www.npmjs.com/package/casual

of card tiles. The page needs to be responsive.

3-4 characters of a name.
- [ ] Add the necessary security features to protect the site from things like XSS,
Clickjacking etc.

click a ‘Load More’ button, which you would need to create.
