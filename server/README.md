# How to

This readme will explain the various commands to run in order to install & run the projet.
- For the following commands, we will assume that your terminal session points to the directory `/server`, in which this file is.
- we will assume your device is ready to work with (dockerized) node projects ( docker, node && npm being already installed )
- 
## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Start 

```bash
node server
```

## Access

The server is running on [this url](http://localhost:5000), but do not expect any data, since it is the root endpoint.
